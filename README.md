üîê Multi-Algorithm Encryption GUI (Python + Tkinter)

This Python project is a comprehensive GUI application built using Tkinter that allows users to explore and interact with five classic cryptographic algorithms:

üõ†Ô∏è Supported Algorithms:

RC4 (CR4): A custom variant of the RC4 stream cipher with a 3-bit implementation.

RSA: Asymmetric key cryptography with custom key generation, encryption, and decryption.

SHA-256: Hashing algorithm implemented fully from scratch (bitwise operations and message scheduling).

AES (CFB Mode): AES encryption/decryption using Cipher Feedback Mode with a fully manual AES core and padding handling.

DES: Full implementation of the Data Encryption Standard using bit-level permutation and S-box logic.

üñ•Ô∏è Features:

Interactive GUI with sidebar navigation for switching between algorithms.

Real-time encryption and decryption inputs with formatted outputs.

Custom base64 encoding/decoding support for AES output display.

Error handling, validation, and user-friendly interface.

üí° Ideal For:

Students and researchers learning about cryptography.

Educational demos of how classical ciphers work under the hood.

Practicing Python GUI programming and low-level algorithm implementation.

üöÄ How to Run:
